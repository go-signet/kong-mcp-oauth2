// Package main: Kong (go-pdk) plugin — unified MCP OAuth front door (steps 2/3/5)
// in front of any number of MCP servers, backed by Signet and verifying tokens
// with RS256 + JWKS.
//
// The MCP authorization handshake (2025-06 spec, building on RFC 9728 / RFC 6750):
//
//	(2) 401 + WWW-Authenticate: Bearer resource_metadata="<PRM URL>"
//	    — tell an unauthenticated client *where the flow lives*, not how to run it.
//	(3) GET /.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/<resource>
//	    — serve Protected Resource Metadata (RFC 9728): which Signet to use,
//	      which scopes, how to present the token.
//	(5) verify the RS256 access token against Signet's JWKS
//	    (signature + exp always; iss, type=access, and aud — the RFC 8707
//	    binding — each enforced unless the matching skip_* toggle relaxes it,
//	    plus scope when required_scopes is set), then forward upstream to the
//	    MCP server.
//
// Kong never runs the OAuth flow. The MCP client drives Auth Code + PKCE against
// Signet itself; Kong only advertises the entry point and validates what comes
// back. One plugin config protects one MCP resource; attach it to as many
// services as you have MCP servers.
//
// Accepted algorithms are pinned to the RS family, so a token signed HS256 with
// the RSA *public* key (the classic alg-confusion forgery) is rejected. JWKS
// fetch / cache / background rotation / rate-limited refetch on an unknown kid
// are handled by MicahParks/keyfunc + jwkset, configured to fail fast: a failed
// initial fetch surfaces as 503 instead of being cached as an empty key set
// (once keys are cached, an unknown kid is a 401 — see Access), and the fetch
// runs under a per-URI lock so a slow Signet cannot stall the whole gateway.
//
// The implementation is split across files within this package:
//
//	config.go    — Config schema, setup() validation, derived per-instance values
//	jwks.go      — shared JWKS keyfunc cache (per-URI build lock, fail-fast fetch)
//	metadata.go  — RFC 8414 AS-metadata discovery and the keyFunc bridge
//	access.go    — the per-request Access handler (steps 2/3/5)
//	main.go      — plugin server bootstrap
